## This file describes all hardcoded values that are required for the project

### Bluetooth-Related Parameters

- SERVICE_UUID and CHARACTERISTIC_UUID: 
  These are unique identifiers used in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication to define the service and its characteristics. 
  - **SERVICE_UUID**: This defines the unique identifier for the service being offered by the BLE device (either the prosthesis or the management tool).
  - **CHARACTERISTIC_UUID**: This defines the unique identifier for a specific characteristic (data or functionality) within that service.
  It is important to note that these UUIDs must be the same for both the management tool and the prosthesis in order to ensure that they can communicate correctly over BLE.
  If there is any mismatch between these UUIDs, the devices will not be able to recognize each other properly for communication.
  SERVICE_UUID = "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0"
  CHARACTERISTIC_UUID = "12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1"

-STACK_SIZE: The stack size for the BLE task. This task will run on Core 0, while the main task will run on Core 1.
  STACK_SIZE = 8192

- MAX_MSG_LEN: The maximum message length of the byte array that can be sent and received over BLE communication. 
  Please note, this value only refers to the length of the `char*` array and does not include other parts of the byte array. 
  This should be defined in both the prosthesis and management tool.
  MAX_MSG_LEN = 128

### Predefined Colors for Touch Screen
The following colors are predefined for easier use in the touch screen interface:
HEX_BLACK = lv_color_hex(0x000000)     // Black
HEX_WHITE = lv_color_hex(0xffffff)     // White
HEX_LIGHT_GRAY = lv_color_hex(0xf4f4f4) // Light Gray
HEX_LIGHT_GRAY_2 = lv_color_hex(0xdfdfdf) // Light Gray_2
HEX_MEDIUM_GRAY = lv_color_hex(0x808080) // Medium Gray
HEX_DARK_GRAY = lv_color_hex(0x404040) // Dark Gray
HEX_DARK_BLUE = lv_color_hex(0x00008b) // Dark Blue
HEX_ROYAL_BLUE = lv_color_hex(0x4169e1) // Royal Blue
HEX_SKY_BLUE = lv_color_hex(0x00bfff) // Sky Blue
HEX_PINK = lv_color_hex(0xffc0cb) // Pink
HEX_PURPLE = lv_color_hex(0x800080) // Purple
HEX_RED = lv_color_hex(0xc30a12) // Red
HEX_BABY_PINK = lv_color_hex(0xf4c2c2) // Baby Pink
HEX_BURGUNDY = lv_color_hex(0x800020) // Burgundy
HEX_GOLD = lv_color_hex(0xffd700) // Gold
HEX_TURQUOISE = lv_color_hex(0x40e0d0) // Turquoise
HEX_LIGHT_PURPLE = lv_color_hex(0xda70d6) // Light Purple
HEX_MEDIUM_PURPLE = lv_color_hex(0x9370db) // Medium Purple
HEX_DARK_PURPLE = lv_color_hex(0x663399) // Dark Purple
HEX_YELLOW = lv_color_hex(0xf7edbe) // Banana Yellow
HEX_GREEN = lv_color_hex(0x047a04) // Green

### Emergency Button Configuration
The following parameters are related to the emergency button:
- buttonPin: The pin number of the emergency button.
- lastPressTime: Stores the last press time of the button.
- debounceDelay: Minimum time between presses (in milliseconds) to avoid stack overflow.

buttonPin = 0              // Pin number for emergency button.
lastPressTime = 0          // Last press time (in ms)
debounceDelay = 1000       // Debounce delay (in ms)

### Backlight Pins for Touch Screen
The backlight pins on the touch screen are currently defined with default values:
TFT_BL = 27                // Backlight pin for TFT screen
GFX_BL = DF_GFX_BL         // Default backlight setting for graphics
